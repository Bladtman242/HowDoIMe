<h1 id="a-joiners-mallet-in-walnut">A Joiner’s Mallet in Walnut</h1>
<p>I decided a good project for me would be making a mallet. I had a reasonably sized block of walnut lying around from my school days, and I needed one. I’d been using a plastic hammer with far too little heft. Generally speaking, the less mass a tool has, the faster you will end up moving it to generate the same momentum before contact. Momentum is <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>s</em> ⋅ <em>v</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>c</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>y</em></span>, so this is a natural compensation. For humans, higher velocity tends to mean less control, so the weight of a tool can make a lot of a difference, especially for delicate work, such as chiseling out dovetails in end-grain. You can see the plastic hammer and mallet parts side-by-side in the pictures below.</p>
<p>Of course a wooden mallet is also more traditional, and undeniably more aesthetic than their synthetic counterparts.</p>
<p>As all things should, this project started out with a little research and inspiration, these pieces are the ones that stood out for me. Paul Sellers’ and Steve Schuler’s are alike with the latter made from beautiful, beautiful spalted pecan wood (Schuler’s design is adapted from Sellers’). Steve Ramsey’s stands out with a beautiful, faceted, maple head.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the end, I went with Sellers’ design for the heft, and rugged look.</p>

<p>The walnut had already been milled at the school, where I had access to mechanical jointers and thickness planers, but after a few months of lying around around in my apartment it had to be done again, this time by hand.</p>
<p>After planing, I cut the block in two in the direction of the grain, one part for the head, one for the handle. This part of the process coincided with me having access to a workshop, so I cut them on a bandsaw. Note the slight taper on the handle. The mallet isn’t glued up, so the mechanical strength of the tapered handle — wedging into a tapered mortise in the head — is all that’s keeping the mallet together!</p>

</div>
<p>The striking surfaces of the head are tapered more aggressively. I’m not sure how this affects the feel of the mallet, but it helps in making the edges and corners obtuse in the final result (later, the head’s top face will be rounded). Sharp angles are weak and prone to breakage. They are also problematic with regard to finishing, as the surface tension in the finish will tend to drag it away from sharp corners.</p>

<p class="caption">The bulk of the mortise is drilled out</p>
</div>
<p>The measurements for the mortise are copied from the handle using marking, gauge, ruler, and square. This way, the taper in the mortise is the same as that on the handle. To save time and effort, the bulk of the mortise is drilled out using an auger bit. The only bit I had was 8mm in diameter. A better fit would have probably saved me some effort.</p>
<p>The faces of the mortise are then cut with a chisel (this is the part where a mallet would have been really useful).</p>
<p>When satisfied with the mortise, the handle is planed down until it slides in with ease.</p>
